# demo-usbguard
Quick demo of USBGuard functionality and usage

Start with a clean base install of RHEL-latest

Then use the scripts for the demo:
* usbguard-setup.sh -- installs the required package, creates an initial rule set, and starts the service
* usbguard-example.sh -- walk thru creation of custom rule
* usbguard-cleanup.sh -- removes all of the changes made by the demo

Lastly, use Demo Walk Thru to show sample use case for USBGuard.
